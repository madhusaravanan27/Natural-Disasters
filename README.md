#**Project Overview**:#

This project aims to explore the impact of natural disasters across the United States from 2000 to 2020. Through data visualization and analysis, the project examines the frequency, severity, human loss, and economic impact of disasters. Multiple dashboards were designed to offer insights into different aspects of natural disasters, leveraging various data-driven analysis techniques.

#**Dashboards**:#

**1. Disaster Analysis**:

Monthly & Yearly Insights and Maximum Occurrences by County
    
Overview: 

This dashboard provides a detailed analysis of natural disasters at the county level, highlighting trends by month and year. It helps identify counties that have faced the highest number of disasters and offers insights into the geographical concentration of disaster activities.

**2. Charting Disaster Dynamics: Mapping Frequency, Recovery Times, and Regional Patterns:**

Overview: 

This dashboard visually maps different disaster categories (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods) across states in the USA. It includes data on the frequency of disasters, as well as the average recovery times for each category.

**3. Exposing Human Loss: Analyzing Natural Disaster Impact Across the USA (2000-2023):**

Overview: 

Focuses on the human toll of natural disasters, including mortality rates, injuries, homelessness, and other significant impacts. The dashboard features interactive visualizations such as bar plots and line graphs to provide a nuanced perspective of the human cost of disasters over time.

**4. Economic Impact: Analyzing Financial Consequences of Natural Disasters (2013-2023)**

Overview: 

This dashboard analyzes the economic damage caused by natural disasters in the USA, from 2013 to 2023. It features time-series analyses and interactive maps that illustrate county-wise economic repercussions and highlight the top states and counties most affected by disasters.

#**Key Accomplishments**:#

**Time Series Analysis:**

Conducted detailed time series analysis of natural disaster occurrences and their economic and human impacts over two decades.

**Geographic Mapping:**

Created interactive maps and heatmaps to visualize disaster hotspots, recovery times, and regional patterns.

**Data Visualization:**

Employed advanced visual techniques to analyze disaster frequencies, human loss, and economic consequences.

**Interactive Dashboards:**

Developed four comprehensive dashboards using tools like Tableau and Power BI to offer insights into various aspects of disaster impacts.

#**Conclusion**#:
